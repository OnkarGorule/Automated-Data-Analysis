Automated Data Analysis
Automated Data Analysis is a web application built with Python (Flask), HTML, and CSS that transforms CSV uploads into immediate statistical insights. Users can upload a CSV file, select statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, nonparametric tests), customize significance levels (Î±-levels), and view interactive charts generated with Plotly.
